Global Store Data Set
 
This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze business data and convert it into actionable insights. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and compare performance across different dimensions such as time, category, or region.

Data was imported and transformed using Power Query, where cleaning, formatting, and preparation were performed. A structured data model was created using relationships between fact and dimension tables to ensure accurate analysis. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create calculated measures for metrics such as totals, averages, growth, and comparisons.

The final report includes interactive visuals like KPI cards, charts, tables, and slicers, enabling users to explore data dynamically and make data-driven business decisions efficiently.

KPI Cards:
           Total Sales
           Total Profit
           Total Quantity

Interactive Slicers:

           Top 5 Sales by Region (Pie Chart)
